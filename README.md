# BioBase
# Home of Biochemical Processes
This is a SQL database that contains information about biochemical processes that occur in the body, such as the conditions under
which they occur, the associated enzymes and intermediate compunds, as well as the location in which each steps occur.

Each process is often studied in isolation from the rest of the body systems, however the interaction between the systems are 
important for understanding the "bigger picture".

Through an html interface, the user (whether it is a researcher or a student) would be able to have access to the database. 
This would give capabilities such as the ability to search through the information, add findings, refine a previous finding, 
or delete a theory that was disproved with new research.
